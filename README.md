# Salary-growth-prediction
# Aim: 
 To analyse Salary_Growth_DataSet to find out whose salary is increased and predict which employee get hike in salary by using of Linear Regression.
 
 # Objective : 
  Study the maximum and minimum salary of employee.Find out employee count on the basis of job roles.We perform EDA and machine learning.
 
 # Methodology : 
 
 Data Collection : I have collected the Sample_Growth_DataSet from Kaggle.
 
 Data Cleaning  : In this step we prepare the data for further analysis by find missing values and removing null values ,
 transforming and standardizing our data.
 
 Exploratory Data Analysis : After cleaning process we study the discriptive statastic , visualize data based on how they related to each other.
 
 Model Development : In this stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model . 
 
# Tools & Technology Used :
Python

jupyter Notebook 

Python Libraries : Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib , Sklearn.

# Conclusion :

We have drawn many intersting inferences from the dataset Salary_Growth_DataSet , heres a summary of the few of them .
